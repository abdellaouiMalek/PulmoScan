# PulmoScan: Deep Learning for Lung Nodule Detection & Classification
ðŸ“Œ An academic project at **ESPRIT School of Engineering**

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

### Motivation
Lung nodule detection and classification is a critical challenge in medical imaging, as early diagnosis significantly improves survival rates. Traditional methods often suffer from:
- **Time-consuming processes**
- **High false positives in CT scans**
- **Human errors**
PulmoScan leverages **Deep Learning** to automate lung nodule detection, improving accuracy and enabling early diagnosis.

### ðŸ”¬ Scientific Significance
Using state-of-the-art **Deep Learning** models, this project aims to:
- **Automate lung nodule detection in medical images**
- **Classify nodules as benign or malignant** with high precision
- **Identify cancer type and determine its stage**
- **Improve diagnostic speed and reduce human intervention**

## âš¡ Methodology

### Data Processing Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gather CT scan images with benign, malignant, and normal lung tissue nodules.
2.  **Data Exploration**: Conducting in-depth analysis to understand data patterns, missing values, and distribution.
3. **Image Preprocessing**: Normalize image sizes and apply noise reduction techniques.
4. **Nodule Detection**: Use Deep Learning models to automatically detect lung nodules in CT scans.
5. **Nodule Classification**: Classify nodules as benign or malignant and identify cancer type and stage.
6. **Model Training**: The model classifies MRI scans into different categories based on tumor types.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics.
8. **Post-Processing**: Generate results in an interpretable format for clinicians, including nodule classification and cancer stage.
